# minishell: a C-based shell that mimics bash

**minishell** is my ninth Codam project and a very defining project for me and all Codam students. This is the first group project and the first really big project that took half a year to finish. Minishell is unique because it consists of so many parts, it requires a deep understanding of the bash terminal and of many different coding concepts. Proper parsing, memory managment and writing readable code were essential to finishing this project after multiple rewrites of parsing, expanding and executing. For this project me and my project partner also introduced **vector** as a datatype in C, which lead to a better understanding of memory managment.
